The auto-qa is a set of tools for turning a normal linux installation into an
automatic test box for the linux kernel.

Parts:

 - updating software
 - kernel configuration
 - kernel compilation
 - kernel installation
 - boot-loader configuration
 - userspace test-suites
    * ltp
    * scrashme
    * ucrashk
    * random module insertion / removal
    * intentionally corrupted disk images (fsfuzzer)
    * intentionally corrupted network packets
 - logging
    * serial console
    * netconsole
 - reporting
    * kerneloops.org

A typical setup will consist of two machines, where one machine is logging the
serial-console output of the other (which is running the test kernel and the
userspace test suites). Since a regular PC normally only has one or two serial
ports, this obviously limits the number of other computers it can log data
from. Other configurations are possible, e.g. with netconsole, where one
machine can log from an unlimited number of other computers (although
netconsole is slightly less reliable than serial console).

The logging machine will usually also run distcc to help in the process of
compiling new kernels.

The auto-qa software will mainly be installed in a new directory "/autoqa".
